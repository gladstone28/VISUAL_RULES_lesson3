# VISUAL RULES

### Font Size

Changing the typeface isnâ€™t the only way to customize the text. Oftentimes, different sections of a web page are highlighted by modifying the font size.

To change the size of text on your web page, you can use the font-size property.

```
p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

```
